 Sorting Analysis

This repository contains the implementation of three sorting algorithms written in C++:

- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

Each algorithm is tested with:
- Sorted input 
- Random input 
- Reversed input 

The code measures the average execution time for each case and prints the results.
